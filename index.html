<div class="we"><p>Winter season: winter is one of the sharply felt six seasons of Bangladesh.
It comprises the two Bengali months called Paush and Magh. It begins in the
middle of November and lasts until the middle of February.
 winter is the coldest season of the year in our country. A cold
wind blows from the north. It is very cold in the morning. The old people and
the children make fire with straw and sit around it to make themselves warm
till sunrise.<del>City-dwellers linger</del>  to get up from bed in the winter morning.
People put on warm clothes in winter. There is dense fog everywhere in the
seen. <small>Dew drops fall on grass and leaves of trees at night. They glitter in
    winter morning.</small> Everything looks hazy. Things at distant places can hardly be
the morning sun and present a very charming view. The sun rises late through
the fog. Nature looks dead and gloomy. The days are shorter and the nights
are longer in winter.</p></div>

<div class="we"><p>Disadvantages: there is nothing on earth which is an unmixed blessing. Winter
is not an exception.<i> It has also certain disadvantages. The poor suffer from
cold at night and in the morning.</i> They cannot buy warm clothes. They shiver
with cold and make a fire in the morning to make themselves warm. They
welcome the sun-rise heartily. Old men suffer from a cough and cold.
Sometimes people are attacked with skin diseases in this season.
